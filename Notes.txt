Additional information for design/architecture of Exercise 3
=====

This document should be seen as an addition to the Exercise 3 description .doc

General
-----

- TESTS, TESTS, TESTS (unit tests, lots of them!)
- think about which communication technique to use (RMI, sockets -> protocol?, http)
  - does it support everything we need? can we check via rmi if we lost connection?

Server
-----

- Its ok if we have some main-loop which is also our main poll-frequency
- We need to somehow handle the "too many sensors to fullfil poll-frequency" case
- bla


Clients
-----

- we should try to make them modular (make the windows "flexible"/dynamic): new sensors should be maybe automatically docked as tabs or sth...
